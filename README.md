This is my fifth project for Technigo. I had so much fun making this piece of Cluedo. In the beginning, I misunderstood the task as I slightly remember playing Cluedo as a child. I thought that the mystery should be kept from the person picking the cards and that the person picking the cards were supposed to guess the details about the murder. Then it became clear that the user is the gameleader who reveals the mystery to the fictional players or something like that, and then it all fell into place for me! Tried to make the site responsive and betterlooking with images, although it's still some delay on the images... Enjoy!


# Short description of task: Build a piece of Cluedo

This week's been all about Javascript, learning about arrays and objects. We're going to hook that up with some html and css in this project!

**So - This week‚Äôs project is to create a piece of the famous board game [Cluedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).**

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

- **Step 1 - Create the objects for suspects, weapons and rooms.**
- **Step 2 - Create arrays to group together suspects, weapons and rooms.**
- **Step 3 - Pick a murderer, a weapon and a room:**
When clicking on the cards, you should invoke the right functions to pick a murderer, a room and a weapon. 
That should be stored in the mysterty object and we should visually see the chosen cards in the browser.
- Step 4 - Reveal the mystery
When clicking the button Reveal Mystery, we should see a message saying something like:
*The murder was committed by Jacob Green, in the living room with a rope.*
**- Stretch Goals üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ**
**_Design_**
- Make the site responsive.
- Spend some time to make it look nice.
- Add images of your suspects and maybe the weapons.

**_Deep-dive_**
- Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
- Add a fourth deck of card, maybe about when the murder was commited.
