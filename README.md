### Project 5 - Piece of the board game Cluedo

This week's project is a piece of the board game Cluedo. The suspects, weapons and rooms are objects in arrays. As you click the decks of cards you get a random suspect etc. When you have chosen a card in every deck and reveal the mystery, everything gets summarized. If you haven't chosen a card in every deck before you click the reveal-button, it's not going to let you reveal the mystery. Deployed site: https://project-cluedo-hippiekick.netlify.com/
